## Deliverables


1. Link to the folder of a ROS package that contains a publisher and a subscriber 



2. List 5 questions you have about ROS following the tutorial, answers you have found and things you still don't get
3. Feedback on the bootcamp: What was easy and what was difficult to understand?
